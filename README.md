## JS library to access NetMD MiniDisc devices

This is a port to TypeScript of the [linux-minidisc](https://github.com/glaubitz/linux-minidisc) project.

It works either in node and every browser supporting the [WebUSB](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/) standard.

There's a minimal CLI called `netmdcli` that I've used for testing, but the primary purpose of this library is to serve the [Web MiniDisc](https://github.com/cybercase/webminidisc) project.
